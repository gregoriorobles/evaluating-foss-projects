# Evaluating development processes

Processes are fundamental in software development. We can model as processes most actions in development projects, from implementing a new feature, to fixing a bug, or even to make a decision about how to implement a feature. Many of these processes can be tracked using information available in software development repositories.

From this point of view, FOSS projects are not different from any other software development project. But, as we discussed in the case of activity, when the project follows an open development model, most of the information needed to track processes is public. Therefore, any third party can use it to evaluate how those processes are being completed.

## Performance

### New features

### Bug fixing

### Code review

## Participants

We can also analyze who participated in specific processes in a project. From that point on, we can assess on several dimensions, discussed in sections below, such as diversity in participation or neutrality.

### Ticket closing

### Code review

### Mailing lists


## Interaction with users

Communication channels can be used by users to solve problems or report them. This interaction can be monitored in several repositories. In our experience, this can be done mainly on both ticketing and asynchronous communication systems. From those, it can be known:

* Who asks for help, or in general comments on issues related to the project.
* Who participates in solving those issues.
* Who of those who participate are developers.

## Diversity in participation

There are several aspects about participation in processes where diversity has a role:

* Participation from diverse time zones in specific process, which may help to speed the process up, or to slow it down, depending on how is that participation.
* Participation by diverse companies.

## Neutrality
