# Kinds of evaluation, reasons to evaluate

There are several aspects of a FOSS project that can be evaluated. Depending on the reasons to evaluate, one or more of these aspects will be relevant. This chapter will review some of the kinds of evaluation that are usual, before entering in more detail in the following chapters in specific examples of these kinds of evaluation.

## What is different in FOSS evaluation

### The importance of transparency

### The many facets of transparency

## Steps in evaluation

Most evaluation methods follow several steps:

* Market research, to decide which products or projects are worth including in the evaluation.
* Defining evaluation criteria.
* Apply evaluation criteria, and produce evaluation results.

## Quantitative versus qualitative evaluation

## Criteria for evaluation

* Intangible factors
* Risk
* Functionality
* ...


## Evaluation of functionality

This is one of the more commons evaluations that are done when selecting tools, either to use or to integrate with others. Usually, this is done in the context of a product acquisition procedure, and considers mainly compliance with requirements, quality, and adaption to certain needs. The evaluation can be used to balance against cost, or to select among products that could fit the requirements.

Most of this evaluation is not different for FOSS and non-FOSS programas, except for the easy of access to the elements to evaluate: source code for the program (for assessing certain aspects of quality) and executable program.

## Evaluation of suitability

Example: OpenBRR

## Evaluation of quality

Example: QSOS, Qualoss

## Evaluation of maturity

Example: Polarsys Maturity Model

## Evaluation of community and development processes

Example: The Bitergia evaluation
