# Kinds of evaluation, reasons to evaluate

There are several aspects of a FOSS project that can be evaluated. Depending on the reasons to evaluate, one or more of these aspects will be relevant. This chapter will review some of the kinds of evaluation that are usual, before entering in more detail in the following chapters in specific examples of these kinds of evaluation.

## Quantitative versus qualitative evaluation

## Evaluation of functionality

This is one of the more commons evaluations that are done when selecting tools, either to use or to integrate with others. Usually, this is done in the context of a product acquisition procedure, and considers mainly compliance with requirements, quality, and adaption to certain needs. The evaluation can be used to balance against cost, or to select among products that could fit the requirements.

Most of this evaluation is not different for FOSS and non-FOSS programas, except for the easy of access to the elements to evaluate: source code for the program (for assessing certain aspects of quality) and executable program.

## Evaluation of suitability

Example: OpenBRR

## Evaluation of quality

Example: QSOS, Qualoss

## Evaluation of maturity

Example: Polarsys Maturity Model

## Evaluation of community and development processes

Example: The Bitergia evaluation
