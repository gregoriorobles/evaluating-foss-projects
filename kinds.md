# Kinds of evaluation, reasons to evaluate

There are several aspects of a FOSS project that can be evaluated. Depending on the reasons to evaluate, one or more of these aspects will be relevant. This chapter will review some of the kinds of evaluation that are usual, before entering in more detail in the following chapters in specific examples of these kinds of evaluation.

## Steps in evaluation

Most evaluation methods follow the following steps:

* Conduct a market research, to decide the subjects (products or projects) to evaluate.
* Define the evaluation criteria.
* Perform the actual evaluation, producing the evaluation results.

The first two can be preformed in any order, and both lead to the actual evaluation. In some cases, the process is iterative:

* some subjects are selected, and evaluated according to certain criteria
* based on the results, the criteria are refined, and the list of subjects redefined
* a new evaluation is performed, which leads to more precise criteria and subjects, until enough data for a final decision is obtained

### Market research

Before starting the actual evaluation, the set of subjects to evaluate must be defined. For that, an extensive research for potential subjects is needed. But this research is not only a matter of finding all options. It would be desiderable to find all the products or projects that could have the slightest possibility of being the most appropriate ones, but that is usually impractical. A more cost-effective approach is to perform an extensive market research, but then follow some criteria to produce a short list for evaluation.

Depending on the resources available for the evaluation, on how expensive that evaluation will be per subject, and on the expected benefits, the size of the this list can be shorter or longer.

In some cases the subjects are already decided beforehand, and this step is skipped. This happens, for example, when a community decides to evaluate itself, or when a company wants to evaluate the products on which they relay for a service they provide.

### Defining evaluation criteria

The evaluation criteria will determine the information to be obtained after the evaluation process.

### Performing evaluation

## What is different in FOSS evaluation

Evaluation of FOSS products is different for the following reasons:

* The easy access to the product to evaluate.
* The quantity and quality of available information
* The importance of the community
* The competing market for deep support

### Access to the product

In the case of non-FOSS, the first barrier to evaluate is the access to the product. For FOSS, the evaluator is usually one download away from evaluating any FOSS product which is adequately packaged. For non-FOSS, just accessing may mean signing a contract, paying for a regular non-exclusive license, or obtaining a usually limited evaluation version.

This means that with FOSS, evaluating the real thing promplty, to any detail, withouth strings of any kind attached is much more simple.

### Available information

For FOSS products, not only the exectuable version of the software is availalble. Per definition, source code is available as well, which allows for its inspection, and the evaluation of aspects of quality that need access to it, such as code quality.

For some non-FOSS, source code may be available, either for all potential users or for those with a certain negotiation power. But it is a rare event.

In addition, if the development model is open, the development information for the FOSS product is kept avaible to anyone with the devloping community. Even when a single company drives the development of a FOSS product, they may decide to run all development in the open. When it is produced by a community, the rule is that the development information is available.

Therefore, the evaluation by third parties of the development processes is possible in the case of FOSS using open development models.

TBD: repositories where the information about development is available.

## Community

Development and user communities are usually key factors for FOSS products. Healthy development communities ensure the future survivability of the product even better than strong companies. Large, involved user communites ensure the needed pressure to keep the product in the leading edge.

Therefore, the evaluatilon of communities is of great importance in the case of FOSS.

## Competing market

The existence of a competing market, with many providers of in-depth support, independent of each other, is possible in the case of FOSS. In the case of non-FOSS, due to the strict control granted by maintaining all copyright rights, only companies in agreement with the producer can provide this kind of services, and therefore no real competing market exists.

TBD: importance of evaluating if such a competing market existis or not, and how it is.

## The importance of transparency

### The many facets of transparency

## Quantitative versus qualitative evaluation

## Criteria for evaluation

* Intangible factors
* Risk
* Functionality
* ...


## Evaluation of functionality

This is one of the more commons evaluations that are done when selecting tools, either to use or to integrate with others. Usually, this is done in the context of a product acquisition procedure, and considers mainly compliance with requirements, quality, and adaption to certain needs. The evaluation can be used to balance against cost, or to select among products that could fit the requirements.

Most of this evaluation is not different for FOSS and non-FOSS programas, except for the easy of access to the elements to evaluate: source code for the program (for assessing certain aspects of quality) and executable program.

## Evaluation of suitability

Example: OpenBRR

## Evaluation of quality

Example: QSOS, Qualoss

## Evaluation of maturity

Example: Polarsys Maturity Model

## Evaluation of community and development processes

Example: The Bitergia evaluation
