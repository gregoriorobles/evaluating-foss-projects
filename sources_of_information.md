# Sources of information

When evaluating FOSS projects there are many potential sources of information, which in many cases, and specially when the project follows the open development paradigm, are public. Some of these sources are:

* Source code management systems (SCM), such as git, Mercurial or Subversion. All changes to the source code, and in some cases, to documentation and other related artifacts, are stored in them. From these systems we can extract any past version of the source code, which allows for code analysis, code inspection, etc. SCM systems store metainformation for every change, which usually includes who authored and committed it, when, the files involved with the corresponding diffs, etc.
* Issue tracking systems (ITS), also names ticketing systems or bug reporting systems, although they are used for much more than reporting bugs. Most projects use them for tracking how bugs are reported and fixed, and how new functionality is proposed, defined and built. But they can also use ITS for tracking the policy decision or the code review process, or even for tracking how the infrastructure is managed. Their repositories are usually modeled as tickets, which experiment changes in state until they are closed. Some examples are Bugzilla, Lanuchpad, GitHub Issues, Allura Tickets, Trac or RedMine.
* Code review systems (CRS). Used to track the code review process. They are usually modeled very similar to ITS, but specialized for code review, and in many cases integrated with SCM. Some examples are Gerrit and GitHub Pull Requests.
* Asynchronous communication systems (ACS). The most classical ones are mailing lists and forums. But more recently others are emerging, such as question/answer systems, of which StackOverflow and Askbot are good examples. The repositories for ACSs are usually modeled as messages, grouped in threads, either implicit or explicit. Each message includes content, but also metainformation such as author, date, etc.
* Synchronous communication systems (SCS). Some examples of them are IRC or more recently, Slack.
* Testing and continuous integration systems (TCI). Some examples are Jenkins, Hudson and TravisCI.
* Web sites and other repositories for content related to the project. They may include documentation, download areas with binaries ready to run, etc.

All these systems usually offer means for persons to interact with them, which can be used to get a first hand impression of how the project is using them. Qualitative evaluations can benefit from this kind of browsing of information. This can be done, for example, by reading comments in commit records, messages in mailing list archives or IRC logs, or the history of tickets in ITSs.

It is also possible to use tools to retrieve information from them, usually via APIs designed for that matter. This allows for the automated retrieval of information for performing quantitative evaluation, or for storing all the data in a database for further analysis.

## Source code management systems

Information in SCMs is usually organized in "changes", which in most systems are named "commits". The information stored with each change is different for different SCM systems, but it always incude the change itself (some way of identifying which lines were affected by the change, and how), and some metainformation. The metainformation is about who and when produced the change, and some other information related to it. For example, in the case of git, that metainformation associated with each change includes:

* A unique identifier for the commit (dubbed the "commit hash").
* The commit id of the previous commit(s) in the history of the repository.
* An identifier for the author (the person writing the change).
* An identifier for the committer (the person committing the change to the repository).
* Dates for authoring and committing actions.
* A comment produced by the author of the change.
* Complete diff with the changes (differences introduced by the change with respect to the previous situation).

### An example of a git commit record

To illustrate how to obtain this information, see below an example. It is the information in a git commit record, as produced using the command ```git show --pretty=fuller``` for a commit in the CVSAnalY repository (excluding the diff):

```
commit 364f67f13b0046c0a0a688b30a1341ff9946ac26
Author:     Santiago Due単as <sduenas@bitergia.com>
AuthorDate: Fri Oct 11 12:55:44 2013 +0200
Commit:     Santiago Due単as <sduenas@bitergia.com>
CommitDate: Fri Oct 11 12:55:44 2013 +0200

    [db] Add author's commit date
    
    Some SCMs, like Git, make a distinction between the dates when
    the committer and author pushed the changes.
    ...
```

The first line shows the commit hash, the next four are the authoring and committing identifiers and dates. In this case, author and committer are the same person, and authoring adn committing dates are the same. After those come several lines with the comment produced by the author, describing the change. After the comment comes the diff, with the list of changes (which were ommitted in the snippet, see below).

The raw information in the commit record can be obtained with ```git show --pretty=raw```:

```
commit 364f67f13b0046c0a0a688b30a1341ff9946ac26
tree c121da67fcba250490b6b326deae46f041b76626
parent 99acc4d7762e3773751f17ae9f0b58169f5e4de0
author Santiago Due単as <sduenas@bitergia.com> 1381488944 +0200
committer Santiago Due単as <sduenas@bitergia.com> 1381488944 +0200

    [db] Add author's commit date
    
    Some SCMs, like Git, make a distinction between the dates when
    the committer and author pushed the changes.
    ...
```

This format is harder to read for humans, but includes more information (such as the previous commit, or "parent"), and is therefore more useful for mining data.

The first lines of the diff that was omitted for the above commit are shown below:

```diff
diff --git a/pycvsanaly2/DBContentHandler.py b/pycvsanaly2/DBContentHandler.py
index 579e103..4b0066d 100644

+++ b/pycvsanaly2/Database.py
```

The first lines of the diff shows how to invoke the diff command to produce the output for the first file changed by the commit (a refers to the situation before the change, b to the situation after the change). Lines changed are those starting with - (removed) or + (added). In this case, a change in a line is modeled as removing the old line and adding a new one with the change.

### Notes on using information from SCM systems

Identifiers for authors and committers are usually a name and an email address. But in some cases, such as Subversion, only a user name is available.

In decentraliized SCMs, such as git, dates for authoring and committing include local timezones, usually those of the computer in which the corresponding action was performed. This allows for timezone analysis to infer regions where developers work. In addition, since times are local, studies on daily schedules can also be performed. But in the case of centralized SCMs, such as Subversion, those dates are for the server where commits took place, which means that no information about local time for developers is avilable.

The information in the SCM allows for the reconstruction of the whole history of the repository. In the case of git, the information about the previous commit or commits (in the case of merges, there is nore than one previous commit) allows for the recovery of the full history of the repository. Using that information and some other hints, you can decide to which branch a change was committed.

The complete diff whcih is available for each change allows for the complete reconstruction of the code modifications, which is the ultimate reason for storing it. But it can be used for infering the files involved, the size of the change, and other parameters.

It is important to note that, from a historical point of view, the information provided by the SCM system is now always reliable. For example, in the case of git, developers can "rewrite" history, when they ammend or rebase. Therefore, a current retrieval of information from a git repository may show different data for some commits in the past than a similar retrieval done some time ago, or even a dfferent list of commits. For systems which only commit with an automated tool after code review, which checks and forbids history rewrites, this is not an issue. But most projects do not have specific rules or technical measueres to avoid history rewrittings, and therefore any results about past history need to be understood as "current past history".

## Issue tracking systems

Information in issue tracking systems is usually organized in "tickets". This is why they are also called ticketing systems. In fact, the job of the ITS is to track the changes to each ticket. Therefore, most ITS maintain both a record for each ticket with its current state, and a history of all changes to their state, or a list of past states.

The information usually found for a ticket is:

* Identifier. Unique identifier for each ticket.
* Summary. A one line text summarizing the purpose of the ticket.
* Description. A longer description of the purpose of the ticket. This can be reporting a bug, requesting a feature, or starting a new task, for example.
* Opening date. When the ticket was opened.
* Ticker opener. An identifier for the person opening the ticket. Depending on the ITS, this can be a full name, an email address, or a user name.
* Ticket asignee. The person asigned by the project to deal with the ticket.
* Priority. A number or a text informing about the priority for the ticket. This is usually set by the ticket opener, but can be later adjusted by developers.
* State. A tag with the current state of the ticket. Examples of states are "open" (ticket opened, but still not dealt with by the project), "assigned" (ticket already assigned to some developer),  "fixed" (ticket is considered to be fixed), "closed" (the issue is considered to be done).

Almost all fields in the ticket are subject to changes. When this happens, the change is recorded, including information about who made the change, when, and in which consisted the change.

In addition, a ticket usually have an associated list of comments. These comments are posted by the different persons who contribute to close the ticket. Some of them may be from the ticket opener, such as when a clarification is posted. Some others may be from people interested in the ticket, such as other people experiencing the same problem. Some others may be by developers trying to solve the issue. Each comment is composed by some text (the comment itself), the posting date, the author of the comment, and maybe some other fields.
