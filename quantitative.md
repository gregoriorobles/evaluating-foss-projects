# Basics of quantitative evaluation

Quantitative evaluation is based on the identification of quantitative parameters that can be significant, and the definition of measurement models for them.

## Activity

In this context, evaluating activity refers to finding signs and traces of activity performed to make the project advance towards its goals. Activity can be of different kinds, such as:

* committing patches to the source code management system
* reporting, commenting or fixing bugs in the issue tracking system
* submitting patches or reviewing them in the code review system
* sending messages to mailing lists or synchronous communication systems

Not all the activity is observable, and suitable for evaluation. For example, in mailing lists it is easy to know when a message is sent: it is enough to explore the list archive. But it is difficult to know who received that message (the list recipients is usually not public), and almost impossible to know who read it (reading is a private activity performed in your own mailer program).

But the observable activity is usually good enough to know about the heartbeat of the project, about how many people is active in different roles, and about the general trends.
