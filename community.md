# Evaluation of FOSS communities

For many FOSS projects, the communities supporting them are the main responsibles for the evolution of the project. Evaluating the communities is therefore fundamental to evaluate the project.

## Different scopes: developers, contributors, users...

FOSS communities are diverse, and may include many different actors. But in general, attending at the scope, the following, usually overlapping, communities can be defined:

* The development community, composed by people in charge of developing and maintaining the software produced by the company.
* The contributing community, composed by all the people actively contributing, not only with code. Examples of contributors are: submitters of bug reports, participants in discussions in mailing lists, translators, writers of documentation, etc.
* The user community, composed by users of the software participating somehow in the community. This can be by asking questions, by attending events, by joining social network groups with interest in the project. etc.
* The ecosystemn community, composed by all stakeholders not only in the project itself, but in all the ecosystem of projects related to it.

For each of these scopes, different evaluation means can be used. But despite this diversity, we can also identify some techniques and parameters that are useful for all of them.  The rest of this chapter will enter into the peculiarities of each community, and will show as well what they have in common and the techniques that are usful for evaluating all of them.

## Evaluating different kinds of communities

### Development communities

The developer community is composed of the persons actually developing and maintaining the products produced by the project: software and  related artifacts, such as documentation. In the case of FOSS projects with open development models based on coordination tools, there is a lot of information available about them. That information can be collected from the following repositories:

* Source code management repository.
* Code review system.
* Issue tracking system.
* Asynchronous communication systems.
* Synchronous communication systems.
