# Quantitative evaluation models

This chapter describes some of the evaluation models that can be used for FOSS projects. We will focus on quantitative models, since they are easier to apply and replicate, and probably, more useful. This does not mean that qualitative models are not important. But since they are more based on qualitative perception, they are very dependent on the expertise and familiarity of the expert performing the evaluation. Quantitative models try to be more independent from the person doing the analysis, but defining quantitative data that tries to capture the relevant aspects of the project being evaluated.

Of course, there are shadows in a continuum ranging from pure quantitative to pure qualitative. In fact, the models mentioned in this section may have some aspects which are at least partially qualitative.

## Basics of quantitative evaluation

Quantitative evaluation is based on the identification of quantitative parameters that can be significant, and the definition of measurement models for them.
